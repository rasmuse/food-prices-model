# A model for simulation of food prices

This repository contains code and data to reproduce simulations presented by Lagi et al. (2015) in a paper (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1413108112)

The article is found here: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/E6119.abstract?sid=352960bc-c551-4909-909e-a3506aac4718

Feel free to use the source code for any purposes you wish.

## Demo

A brief demonstration of some problems with the model is shown in the Jupyter notebook: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rasmuse/food-prices-model/blob/master/food-price-model-demo.ipynb
